## Introduction

> CowAgent is both an out-of-the-box AI super assistant and a highly extensible Agent framework. You can extend it with new model interfaces, channels, built-in tools, and the Skills system to flexibly implement various customization needs.

- ✅ **Autonomous Task Planning**: Understands complex tasks and autonomously plans execution, continuously thinking and invoking tools until goals are achieved.
- ✅ **Long-term Memory**: Automatically persists conversation memory to local files and databases, including core memory and daily memory, with keyword and vector retrieval support.
- ✅ **Skills System**: Implements a Skills creation and execution engine, supports installing skills from [Skill Hub](https://skills.cowagent.ai), GitHub, etc., or creating custom Skills through conversation.
- ✅ **Tool System**: Built-in tools for file I/O, terminal execution, browser automation, scheduled tasks, messaging, and more — autonomously invoked by the Agent.
- ✅ **CLI System**: Provides terminal commands and in-chat commands for process management, skill installation, configuration, and more.
- ✅ **Multimodal Messages**: Supports parsing, processing, generating, and sending text, images, voice, files, and other message types.
- ✅ **Multiple Model Support**: Supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, MiniMax, GLM, Qwen, Kimi, Doubao, and other mainstream model providers.
- ✅ **Multi-platform Deployment**: Runs on local computers or servers, integrable into WeChat, Web, Feishu, DingTalk, WeChat Official Account, and WeCom applications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The project provides a one-click script for installation, configuration, startup, and management:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/run.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/run.ps1 | iex
```

After running, the Web service starts by default. Access `http://localhost:9899/chat` to chat.

Script usage: [One-click Install](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/guide/quick-start). After installation, you can also use `cow start`, `cow stop`, and other [CLI commands](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/cli/index) to manage the service.

### Manual Installation

**1. Clone the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat
cd chatgpt-on-wechat/
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-optional.txt   # optional but recommended
```

**3. Install Cow CLI (recommended)**

```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

After installation, use `cow` commands to manage the service (start, stop, update, etc.) and skills. See [Command Docs](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/cli/index).

**4. Install browser (optional)**

If you need the Agent to operate a browser (visit web pages, fill forms, etc.):

```bash
cow install-browser
```

This auto-installs `playwright` and Chromium. See [Browser Tool Docs](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/tools/browser).

**5. Configure**

```bash
cp config-template.json config.json
```

Fill in your model API key and channel type in `config.json`. See the [configuration docs](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/guide/manual-install) for details.

**6. Run**

```bash
cow start              # recommended, requires Cow CLI
python3 app.py         # or run directly
```

For server deployment, use `cow` commands to manage the service:

```bash
cow start              # start in background
cow stop               # stop service
cow restart            # restart service
cow status             # check running status
cow logs               # view logs
cow update             # pull latest code and restart
```

Or use the traditional way:

```bash
nohup python3 app.py & tail -f nohup.out
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
curl -O https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml with your config
sudo docker compose up -d
sudo docker logs -f chatgpt-on-wechat
```

### Coding Plan

Coding Plan is a monthly subscription package offered by various providers, ideal for high-frequency Agent usage. All providers can be accessed via OpenAI-compatible mode:

```json
{
  "bot_type": "openai",
  "model": "MODEL_NAME",
  "open_ai_api_base": "PROVIDER_CODING_PLAN_API_BASE",
  "open_ai_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

- `bot_type`: Must be `openai`
- `model`: Model name supported by the provider
- `open_ai_api_base`: Provider's Coding Plan API Base (different from standard pay-as-you-go)
- `open_ai_api_key`: Provider's Coding Plan API Key

> Note: Coding Plan API Base and API Key are usually separate from standard pay-as-you-go ones. Please obtain them from each provider's platform.

Supported providers include Alibaba Cloud, MiniMax, Zhipu GLM, Kimi, Volcengine, and more. For detailed configuration of each provider, see the [Coding Plan documentation](https://docs.cowagent.ai/en/models/coding-plan).
