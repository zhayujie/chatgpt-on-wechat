description: One-click install and manage CowAgent with scripts
---

The project provides scripts for one-click install, configuration, startup, and management. Script-based deployment is recommended for quick setup.

Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. Requires Python 3.7-3.12 (3.9 recommended).

## Install Command

```bash
bash <(curl -sS https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/run.sh)
```

The script automatically performs these steps:

1. Check Python environment (requires Python 3.7+)
2. Install required tools (git, curl, etc.)
3. Clone project to `~/chatgpt-on-wechat`
4. Install Python dependencies
5. Guided configuration for AI model and channel
6. Start service

By default, the Web service starts after installation. Access `http://localhost:9899/chat` to begin chatting.

## Management Commands

After installation, use these commands to manage the service:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `./run.sh start` | Start service |
| `./run.sh stop` | Stop service |
| `./run.sh restart` | Restart service |
