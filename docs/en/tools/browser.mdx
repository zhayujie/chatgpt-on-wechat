# browser

Use a browser to access and interact with web pages, supports JavaScript-rendered dynamic pages.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Install Command |
| --- | --- |
| `browser-use` ≥ 0.1.40 | `pip install browser-use` |
| `markdownify` | `pip install markdownify` |
| `playwright` + chromium | `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium` |

## Use Cases

- Access specific URLs to get page content
- Interact with web page elements (click, type, etc.)
- Verify deployed web pages
- Scrape dynamic content requiring JS rendering

<Note>
  The browser tool has heavy dependencies. If not needed, skip installation. For lightweight web content retrieval, use the `web-fetch` skill instead.
