# memory

The memory tool contains two sub-tools: `memory_search` (search memory) and `memory_get` (read memory files).

## Dependencies

No extra dependencies, available by default. Managed by the Agent Core memory system.

## memory_search

Search historical memory with hybrid keyword and vector retrieval.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | Yes | Search query |

## memory_get

Read the content of a specific memory file.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Yes | Relative path to memory file (e.g. `MEMORY.md`, `memory/2026-01-01.md`) |
| `start_line` | integer | No | Start line number |
| `end_line` | integer | No | End line number |

## How It Works

The Agent automatically invokes memory tools in these scenarios:

- When the user shares important information → stores to memory
- When historical context is needed → searches relevant memory
- When conversation reaches a certain length → extracts summary for storage
