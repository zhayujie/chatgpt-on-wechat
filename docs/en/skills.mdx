# Skills System

The Skills system provides infinite extensibility for the Agent. Each Skill consists of a description file, an execution script (optional), and resources (optional), describing how to complete a specific type of task. Skills enable the Agent to follow instructions to complete complex workflows, call various tools, or integrate with third-party systems.

## Skill Types

### Built-in Skills

Located in the `skills/` directory of the project, automatically enabled based on dependency conditions (API keys, system commands, etc.).

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `skill-creator` | Skill creator — create custom skills through conversation |
| `bocha-search` | Web search capability |
| `openai-image-vision` | Image recognition using OpenAI vision models |
| `linkai-agent` | LinkAI agent integration for third-party knowledge bases and plugins |
| `web-scraper` | Web page content extraction |

### Custom Skills

Created by users through conversation, stored in the workspace (`~/cow/skills/`). Custom skills can implement any complex business workflow or third-party system integration.

## Creating Skills

Use the built-in `skill-creator` to create skills through natural language conversation:

- Codify workflows into reusable skills
- Send API documentation and examples to the Agent for automatic integration
- Create customized automation pipelines

## Web Search

The built-in `bocha-search` skill provides web search capability:

1. Create an API Key at [Bocha Open Platform](https://open.bochaai.com/)
2. Configure `BOCHA_SEARCH_API_KEY` via the `env_config` tool or send it directly to the Agent

## Image Recognition

The `openai-image-vision` skill supports image recognition using models like `gpt-4.1-mini` and `gpt-4.1`.

Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` via `config.json` or the `env_config` tool to enable.

## LinkAI Agents

The `linkai-agent` skill integrates all agents from [LinkAI](https://link-ai.tech/) as Skills, enabling multi-agent decision-making.

### Configuration

1. Configure `LINKAI_API_KEY` (via `env_config` tool or `linkai_api_key` in `config.json`)
2. Add agent descriptions in `skills/linkai-agent/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "app_code": "G7z6vKwp",
      "app_name": "LinkAI Support",
      "app_description": "Use this agent only for LinkAI platform questions"
    },
    {
      "app_code": "SFY5x7JR",
      "app_name": "Content Creator",
      "app_description": "Use this agent for image or video creation"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Agent selects the appropriate agent based on name and description, and calls the corresponding app via `app_code`.

## Skill File Structure

Each skill directory follows this structure:

```
skills/
├── my-skill/
│   ├── SKILL.md          # Skill description and instructions
│   ├── run.py            # Execution script (optional)
│   └── resources/        # Additional resources (optional)
```
