title: Models Overview
description: Supported models and recommended choices for CowAgent
---

CowAgent supports mainstream LLMs from domestic and international providers. Model interfaces are implemented in the project's `models/` directory.

<Note>
  For Agent mode, the following models are recommended based on quality and cost: MiniMax-M2.5, glm-5, kimi-k2.5, qwen3.5-plus, claude-sonnet-4-6, gemini-3.1-pro-preview
</Note>

## Configuration

Configure the model name and API key in `config.json` according to your chosen model. Each model also supports OpenAI-compatible access by setting `bot_type` to `chatGPT` and configuring `open_ai_api_base` and `open_ai_api_key`.

You can also use the [LinkAI](https://link-ai.tech) platform interface to flexibly switch between multiple models with support for knowledge base, workflows, and other Agent capabilities.
