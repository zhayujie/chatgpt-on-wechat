# linkai-agent

Use agents from the [LinkAI](https://link-ai.tech/) platform as Skills for multi-agent decision-making. The Agent intelligently selects based on agent names and descriptions, calling the corresponding application or workflow via `app_code`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LINKAI_API_KEY` | LinkAI platform API key, created in [Console](https://link-ai.tech/console/interface) |
| `curl` | System command (usually pre-installed) |

Configuration:

- Configure `LINKAI_API_KEY` via the `env_config` tool
- Or set `linkai_api_key` in `config.json`

## Configure Agents

Add available agents in `skills/linkai-agent/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "app_code": "G7z6vKwp",
      "app_name": "LinkAI Customer Support",
      "app_description": "Select this assistant only when the user needs help with LinkAI platform questions"
    },
    {
      "app_code": "SFY5x7JR",
      "app_name": "Content Creator",
      "app_description": "Use this assistant only when the user needs to create images or videos"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Agent will automatically select the appropriate LinkAI agent based on the user's question.
