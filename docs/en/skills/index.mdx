title: Skills Overview
description: CowAgent skills system introduction
---

Skills provide infinite extensibility for the Agent. Each Skill consists of a description file (`SKILL.md`), execution scripts (optional), and resources (optional), describing how to accomplish specific types of tasks.

The difference between Skills and Tools: Tools are atomic operations implemented in code (e.g., file read/write, command execution), while Skills are high-level workflows based on description files that can combine multiple Tools to complete complex tasks.

## Built-in Skills

Located in the project `skills/` directory, automatically enabled based on dependency conditions:

| Skill | Description | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`skill-creator`](/en/skills/skill-creator) | Create custom skills through conversation | None |
| [`openai-image-vision`](/en/skills/image-vision) | Recognize images using OpenAI vision models | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| [`linkai-agent`](/en/skills/linkai-agent) | Integrate LinkAI platform agents | `LINKAI_API_KEY` |
| [`web-fetch`](/en/skills/web-fetch) | Fetch web page text content | `curl` (enabled by default) |

## Custom Skills

Created by users through conversation, stored in workspace (`~/cow/skills/`), can implement any complex business process and third-party system integration.

## Skill Loading Priority

1. **Workspace skills** (highest): `~/cow/skills/`
2. **Project built-in skills** (lowest): `skills/`

Skills with the same name are overridden by priority.
