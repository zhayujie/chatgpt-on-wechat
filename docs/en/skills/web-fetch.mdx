# web-fetch

Use curl to fetch web pages and extract readable text content. A lightweight web access method without browser automation.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `curl` | System command (usually pre-installed) |

This skill has `always: true` set, enabled by default as long as the system has the `curl` command.

## Usage

Automatically invoked when the Agent needs to fetch content from a URL, no extra configuration needed.

## Comparison with browser Tool

| Feature | web-fetch (skill) | browser (tool) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependencies | curl only | browser-use + playwright |
| JS rendering | Not supported | Supported |
| Page interaction | Not supported | Supports click, type, etc. |
| Best for | Static page text | Dynamic web pages |

<Tip>
  For most web content retrieval scenarios, web-fetch is sufficient. Only use the browser tool when you need JS rendering or page interaction.
