## 1. Create an App

1. Go to [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app#/corp/app), click **Create App**, and fill in the information
2. Add the **Bot** capability
3. Configure bot info and click **Publish**

## 2. Project Configuration

1. Get `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from **Credentials & Basic Info**

2. Add to `config.json`:

```json
{
  "channel_type": "dingtalk",
  "dingtalk_client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "dingtalk_client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

3. Install dependency:

pip3 install dingtalk_stream
