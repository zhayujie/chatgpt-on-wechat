# CowAgent 2.0

CowAgent 2.0 is a comprehensive upgrade from a chatbot to an **AI super assistant**! It can now autonomously think and plan tasks, has long-term memory, operates computers and external resources, and creates and executes skills — truly understanding you and growing alongside you.

**Release Date**: 2026.02.03 | [GitHub Release](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/releases/tag/2.0.0)

## Key Updates

### Agent Core Capabilities

- **Complex Task Planning**: Understands complex tasks and autonomously plans execution, continuously thinking and calling tools until goals are achieved, with multi-turn reasoning and context understanding
- **Long-term Memory**: Automatically persists conversation memory to local files and databases, including core memory and daily memory, with keyword and vector search support
- **Built-in System Tools**: 10+ built-in tools including file operations, Bash terminal, browser, file sending, scheduled tasks, memory management, etc.
- **Skills**: New Skill execution engine with built-in skills and support for custom skill development through natural language conversation
- **Security and Cost**: Controls Agent access security through secret key management, prompt controls, and system permissions; limits token costs through max memory turns, max context tokens, and tool execution steps

### Other Updates

- **Channel Improvements**: Feishu and DingTalk channels support WebSocket connections (no public IP needed), with image/file message support
- **Model Updates**: Added claude-sonnet-4-5, gemini-3-pro-preview, glm-4.7, MiniMax-M2.1, qwen3-max, and other latest models
- **Deployment**: Added one-click install, configure, run, and management script to simplify deployment

## Long-term Memory System

The Agent proactively stores information when users share important details, and automatically extracts summaries when conversations reach a certain length. Supports hybrid retrieval with semantic search and vector search.

On **first startup**, the Agent proactively asks for key information and records it in the workspace (default `~/cow`) including agent settings, user identity, and memory files.

During **long-term conversations**, the Agent intelligently records and retrieves memories, continuously updating its settings, user preferences, and summarizing experiences — achieving true autonomous thinking and continuous growth.

## Task Planning and Tool Calling

The Agent intelligently selects and calls tools based on task requirements to complete various complex operations.

### Terminal and File Access

The most fundamental tool capabilities. Users can interact with the Agent from mobile devices to operate resources on personal computers or servers:

### Application Programming

With programming and system access capabilities, the Agent can handle the complete **Vibecoding workflow** — from information search, asset generation, coding, testing, deployment, Nginx configuration, to publishing — all from a single mobile command.

### Scheduled Tasks

Supports **one-time tasks, fixed intervals, and Cron expressions**, with two trigger modes: **fixed message sending** or **Agent dynamic task execution**:

## Skills System

Each Skill consists of a description file, execution script (optional), and resources (optional), providing infinite extensibility.

### Skill Creator

Quickly create skills through conversation, codifying workflows or integrating with any third-party API:
